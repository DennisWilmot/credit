Project Overview: Loan Risk Assessment and Interest Rate Optimization

This project focuses on building a loan risk assessment and interest rate optimization platform. The primary objective is to assess the risk associated with providing loans and dynamically adjust the interest rate to account for the likelihood of borrower default. The system leverages machine learning models, particularly logistic regression, to predict the probability of default (PD) based on borrower attributes such as income, credit score, loan amount, and debt-to-income ratio.

Using the predicted default probability (PD), along with assumptions on Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD), the platform calculates the expected loss (EL) for each loan. A risk tolerance threshold is defined by the user, representing the maximum expected loss they are willing to accept. If the expected loss exceeds this threshold, the system increases the interest rate to mitigate the higher risk, ensuring that loans remain profitable.

Key steps include:
- Creating synthetic data for borrower attributes and loan terms.
- Data Input: Borrower attributes such as income, credit score, and loan amount are entered.
- Default Prediction: A logistic regression model predicts the likelihood of default.
- Expected Loss Calculation: The platform calculates the expected loss using the formula (EL = PD * LGD * EAD).
- Risk Tolerance: The user-defined risk tolerance helps determine whether the loanâ€™s interest rate should be adjusted based on the expected loss.
- Interest Rate Optimization: If the expected loss exceeds the risk tolerance, the interest rate is increased to compensate for the elevated risk.

This platform enables lenders to make informed decisions, adjusting loan terms dynamically to ensure both profitability and risk management.

synthetic_data_text = "created synthetic data for 1000 loan applicants with attributes such as income, credit score, employment type, loan amount, loan duration, and debt-to-income ratio. The interest rate was calculated based on the credit score, loan amount, and debt-to-income ratio, with additional assumptions for default probability and loss given default. Income was normally distributed with a mean of $50,000 and a standard deviation of $15,000. Credit scores ranged from 300 to 850, and employment types included full-time, part-time, and self-employed. Loan amounts varied from $1,000 to $50,000, with durations between 6 and 60 months. Debt-to-income ratios ranged from 0.1 to 0.5."
